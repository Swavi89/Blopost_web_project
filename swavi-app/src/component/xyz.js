                    My Halloween decorations are staying in the box this year.
                    To be honest, they didn’t make it out of the box last year
                    either. My Halloween spirit has officially been bludgeoned
                    to death by teenagers who no longer care and a persistent
                    October fear of the Northern California wildfires. And
                    speaking of fear, isn’t there more than enough of that
                    going around? Maybe all of us can pretend that Halloween
                    isn’t even happening this year?
